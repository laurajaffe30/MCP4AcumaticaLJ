# Changelog

All notable changes to MCP4Acumatica are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
semantic-ish versioning. Release tags use the form `25R2-<version>` (the `25R2`
prefix tracks the targeted Acumatica release, 2025 R2).

## [0.35.0] - 2026-06-13
### Fixed
- **`substringof`/`startswith`/`endswith` filters silently returned `[]`.** Acumatica's contract-REST `$filter` parser returns an empty set (HTTP 200, no error) when a boolean string function is compared to a literal — `substringof('X', Field) eq true` — but works for the bare function. Models habitually append `eq true` (valid OData v3), so every partial-text/"contains" search returned zero rows. `normalizeODataFilter()` (`src/lib/odata-filter.ts`) now strips a trailing `eq true` off the three boolean functions before the request goes out, for both `acumatica_list_entities` and `acumatica_run_inquiry`. `eq false` is left verbatim — the only equivalent negation (`not substringof(...)`) is rejected by the contract API with a 500. (This was a parser quirk, not a URL-encoding bug.)
### Added
- **Structured errors for non-optimizable `$filter` queries.** Acumatica's OData filter binder 500s when it can't apply a `$filter` to a complex document entity (unbound/computed/BQL-delegate field → `CannotOptimizeException`, a child-collection field → "not a single value", a type mismatch, or an unknown field). `getFilterErrorKind()` (`src/lib/complex-entities.ts`) classifies these and `acumatica_list_entities` returns a structured, actionable error (`filterNotApplicable: true`, `filterErrorKind`, a key-field hint, and a pointer to `acumatica_describe_entity` / a Generic Inquiry) instead of an opaque "Acumatica internal error".
- **False-negative guard for complex document entities.** When `acumatica_list_entities` returns 0 rows on a non-key filter against a known complex entity (`PurchaseOrder`, `Shipment`, `PhysicalInventoryCount`), the response now includes a `possibleFalseNegative: true` warning — Acumatica can silently drop a non-optimizable filter and return `[]` even when matching records exist, so the model is told not to conclude "no such record exists" and to verify with a keyed lookup or a Generic Inquiry.
- **Tool descriptions** for `acumatica_list_entities` / `acumatica_run_inquiry` now tell the model to write boolean functions bare (no `eq true`) and call out the complex-document-entity filtering limitation.
- **Unit-test harness** — first tests in the repo (`test/`, Node's built-in `node --test` runner with TypeScript type-stripping, zero new dependencies), wired to `npm test`. Covers `normalizeODataFilter` and the filter-error classification helpers.

## [0.34.2] - 2026-06-11
### Fixed
- The OIDC-fallback `UserSecurityInfo` identity lookup in `/callback` hardcoded the contract version `25.200.001` instead of using `ACUMATICA_ENDPOINT_VERSION`. On a re-targeted instance (e.g. 26R1) that path would 404, silently dropping users to the UUID-based key fallback and breaking token reuse across sessions. Now uses the configured endpoint version like every other contract-API URL. (Originally authored by Adam Coates in the hoser-dev fork.)

## [0.34.1] - 2026-06-11
### Docs
- Documented the DAC-layer stance: DAC metadata is intentionally **not** a tool — stock DACs are covered by Acumatica's public DAC Schema Browser (`help.acumatica.com/dacBrowser`, reachable via the client's web access), custom DACs by the customization source, and API-exposed custom fields by the existing schema tools. (A DAC-via-GI customization was prototyped and dropped as redundant + high-maintenance.)
- Added a "DAC-layer questions" pointer to `/docs/schema-discovery`; removed a third-party-comparison aside and a stale "DAC index (planned)" item from the upgrade guide.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-06-11
### Added
- **Schema-knowledge tools** for power users building integrations and customizations:
  - `acumatica_search_schema` — find entities by name/keyword and/or "which entities contain field X".
  - `acumatica_get_schema_entity` — full offline schema for one entity (fields + types, actions, `$expand` sub-entities).
  - `acumatica_list_schema_entities` — browse/filter the entity catalog by name/module prefix.
  - `acumatica_explain_gi_xml` — stateless structural summary of a pasted Generic Inquiry definition XML (tables, joins, parameters, filters, results).
- These answer from an **offline schema index** built from your instance's own `swagger.json` (always current, includes your customizations, no third-party IP), instead of sampling live records to infer shape. The three index-backed tools register only when the index is present; the GI explainer is always available.
- New platform abstraction `IBlobStore` (CF impl `CloudflareR2BlobStore`) on `AppEnv.indexStore`, backed by a new `mcp4acumatica-index` R2 bucket (`INDEX_STORE`). Self-hosting story preserved.
- Open-source ingestion scripts (`scripts/build-schema-index.mjs`, `scripts/upload-indexes.mjs`) + `npm run build-index`; `setup.sh` builds/uploads the schema index automatically after deploy when `swagger.json` is present.
- New `/docs/schema-discovery` documentation page.
### Notes
- Acumatica **documentation** lookups are intentionally not a tool — the public Help Wiki (<https://help.acumatica.com/>) is reachable via the AI client's own web search. DAC metadata and GI XML example libraries are planned as later, private-index workstreams.

## [0.33.2] - 2026-06-08
### Added
- This `CHANGELOG.md` (full history reconstructed from git tags/commits) and a `/docs/changelog` page on the documentation site.
### Docs
- Commit and close-session checklists now include a changelog-update step.

## [0.33.1] - 2026-06-07
### Fixed
- **Sessions no longer die after ~1 hour of idle.** Root cause: `/authorize` never requested the `offline_access` scope, so Acumatica/IdentityServer issued no refresh token — the stored refresh token was empty and every refresh failed with `400 invalid_request`. Now requests `offline_access` (the Connected App must permit it).
- `TokenManager` `readToken()` reconciles DO storage vs KV by recency, so a failed callback seed can't pin a stale, already-rotated token.
### Added
- `token_resolve_outcome` diagnostic logging (reason on every non-ok token resolution).
- Self-hosting guide now documents the `offline_access` requirement and the `ITokenProvider` serialization step.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-06-07
### Changed
- **Per-user token-refresh serialization via a new `TokenManager` Durable Object.** All token access for a user funnels through one globally-unique DO (`idFromName(username)`), coalescing concurrent refreshes. Eliminates the cross-isolate rotation race where concurrent sessions reused a rotated refresh token and one was spuriously evicted.
- Token logic kept platform-agnostic behind a new `ITokenProvider` abstraction on `AppEnv` (CF impl `DOTokenProvider`; self-host = a distributed lock).
### Docs
- Documented that Claude.ai authenticates via CIMD (not DCR), and recorded the Claude.ai reconnect/dead-state and `/authorize`-500-on-bad-client_id findings.

## [0.32.1] - 2026-06-06
### Fixed
- Dead refresh tokens are now classified by **HTTP status** (any `4xx` → re-auth; `5xx`/`429` → transient), not by matching the `invalid_grant` string — Acumatica's `400` body doesn't reliably parse to that code, which previously made the model loop on "try again shortly" instead of re-authenticating.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-05-29
### Added
- Transparent re-auth on a dead Acumatica refresh token: a `ReauthRequiredError` revokes the user's MCP grant so the client silently re-runs OAuth instead of a manual disconnect/reconnect.

## [0.31.1] - 2026-05-10
### Docs
- Documented the Generic Inquiry "no description metadata" gap and three potential cure paths.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md`; `.claude/` gitignored; anonymized the `workers.dev` hostname in tracked config.

## [0.30.1] - 2026-05-10
### Changed
- Set `preview_urls: true` in the tracked `wrangler.jsonc` so deploys don't flip it off on config drift.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- GUI install path ("Deploy to Cloudflare" button) with `wrangler.jsonc` as the tracked deploy template; one-shot `setup.sh` and one-line `install.sh`.
- Preflight diagnostics (`/docs/admin/preflight`) and `/callback` OAuth-error mapping.
### Changed
- Tool-description rework (instance-specific ID wording, lookup pointers, expand/denylist/cache disclosures); `runGetter` empty-string guard for required path params.

## [0.29.1] - 2026-04-16
### Fixed
- Persist the DO log buffer to `ctx.storage` so a buffer flush survives DO eviction (alarm runs on a fresh instance).

## [0.29.0] - 2026-04-16
### Security
- Closed the full security-audit review (all critical/high/medium/low items).

## [0.26.1] - 2026-04-16

### Security
- Closed audit items M1, M2, M5, M6.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-04-16
### Security
- Closed audit criticals C1–C3 and mediums M3, M7.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-04-16
### Fixed
