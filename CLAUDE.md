# CLAUDE.md — Project Memory for MCP4Acumatica

## Project Overview

Remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server on Cloudflare Workers that connects Claude to an Acumatica ERP 2025 R2 instance via the contract-based REST API. Each user authenticates directly with Acumatica — their Acumatica role controls what records they can access.

### Storage Abstraction (Platform Portability)

Tool handlers, the Acumatica HTTP client, config, and caching are decoupled from Cloudflare via two abstractions:

- **`IKeyValueStore`** (`src/lib/kv-store.ts`) — Platform-agnostic interface for key-value storage (get, put, delete, list). Cloudflare Workers uses `CloudflareKVStore` which wraps `KVNamespace`.
- **`AppEnv`** (`src/types/acumatica.ts`) — Portable environment type containing Acumatica connection settings and a `store: IKeyValueStore`. All tool handlers and shared libraries use `AppEnv`. The Cloudflare-specific `Env` extends `AppEnv` with CF bindings (`TOKEN_STORE`, `OAUTH_KV`, `MCP_OBJECT`, etc.).

This design allows future self-hosted adapters (Node.js + Redis/SQLite) to reuse all tool handlers without modification. See `docs/self-hosting-guide.md`.

## OAuth Flow

Claude → Worker `/authorize` → Acumatica login (with `openid profile email api` scopes) → Worker `/callback` → OIDC userinfo → canary GI role check → `/consent` interstitial → token stored → MCP session active.

Acumatica is the sole identity provider. Users log in with their Acumatica credentials (or via whatever SSO their Acumatica instance is configured with). The MCP server does not manage identity separately — it delegates entirely to Acumatica.

### Access Control & Governance

1. **Role gate (canary GI):** After login, the callback queries the `MCPAccess` Generic Inquiry via OData. This GI is assigned only to the `MCP Access` role in Acumatica. If the OData query returns 200, the user has the role; if 403, they don't. This avoids exposing user/role data — the GI content is irrelevant, it's purely an access gate. Users without the role see a 403 page directing them to contact their Acumatica admin. The role name is configurable via `ACUMATICA_MCP_ROLE` env var.

2. **Consent interstitial:** Users who pass the role check see a consent page explaining that data will be processed by AI, access is logged, and sensitive fields are redacted. They must acknowledge before the MCP session activates.

3. **Sensitive field redaction:** Tool responses are automatically scanned for sensitive field names (SSN, bank accounts, salary, credit card, etc.) using pattern matching. Matched values are replaced with `[REDACTED]`. Patterns are configurable via `REDACT_PATTERNS` (add) and `REDACT_SKIP` (whitelist) env vars. See `src/lib/redact.ts`.

4. **Enhanced audit logging:** All tool invocations include the Acumatica username, tool parameters (what was queried), duration, and success/error status. Auth events (login success, access denied, consent accepted) are logged separately in the Worker handler. Tool invocation and field redaction logs are written directly to R2 from the Durable Object (Cloudflare Logpush only captures Worker-level traces, not DO traces). The `writeLogsToR2()` function in `src/lib/logger.ts` writes NDJSON entries to `do-logs/{date}/{timestamp}-{random}.ndjson` keys in R2 and returns a boolean success flag. To minimize R2 file count, the DO buffers log entries (`logBuffer` in `AcumaticaMcpServer`) and flushes them when the buffer reaches 25 entries OR a DO alarm fires 15 seconds after the last buffered entry. The buffer is mirrored to persistent DO storage (`ctx.storage` key `log_buffer`) on every append, because the alarm handler runs on a **fresh DO instance** after eviction — in-memory state is gone by then. `flushLogs()` calls `hydrateBuffer()` first so the alarm path reads the persisted entries from storage before writing to R2. Without this, short sessions (<25 entries) would be dropped whenever the DO was evicted between the tool call and the alarm firing. Flushes are serialized via a `flushing` mutex so the threshold path and alarm path cannot race over the buffer. If an R2 put fails, `flushLogs()` re-enqueues the snapshot at the head of the buffer, re-persists it, and schedules a retry alarm (30 s); previously a failed put silently dropped the batch. Alarms are registered via `this.ctx.storage.setAlarm(...)` and handled in the class's `alarm()` method, which Cloudflare wakes the DO specifically to run even if it has gone idle. Console.log is preserved for `wrangler tail` live debugging. The admin console at `/docs/admin` reads both Logpush-written and DO-written logs from R2 using streaming server-side pagination (prefix-scoped R2 listing, parallel batched reads, incremental filtering, early-exit once one page of results is collected) to keep load times fast even for multi-day queries.

5. **Pagination refusal semantics:** The list/query tools (`acumatica_list_entities`, `acumatica_run_inquiry`, `acumatica_list_generic_inquiries`) hard-cap results at `ACUMATICA_MAX_RECORDS` (default 1000, runtime-overridable via the admin console → KV `config:acumatica_max_records`). When a response hits the cap, the tool returns a structured envelope `{ results, truncated: true, mayBeComplete: true, paginationSupported: false, actionRequired: "..." }` instructing the model to stop calling and ask the user to refine `filterExpression`/`titleFilter`. The envelope explicitly states that the result *may* be complete — Acumatica's contract API and OData GI endpoints don't report a total count, so a response exactly at the cap is indistinguishable from a larger underlying result set. No server-side cooldown — the semantic response is the mechanism. The numeric cap is validated at write time by the admin console (positive integer, ≤ 10 000) via `validateConfigValue()` in `src/lib/config.ts`; downstream readers additionally use `parsePositiveIntConfig()` to defend against bad env-var values.

6. **Rate limiting.** `withRateLimit()` (`src/lib/rate-limiter.ts`) enforces two caps keyed by Acumatica username: in-isolate concurrency (max 3 active) and a per-minute KV-backed bucket (`ratelimit:{username}:{minute}`, TTL 120 s, max 40). Keying per-user prevents users on the same isolate from contaminating each other's limits; the KV bucket survives DO/isolate recycling so a client cannot bypass the per-minute cap by reconnecting. Active slots are tracked as `{id → startedAt}` rather than a bare counter; any slot older than 60 s is pruned as leaked, so an uncaught rejection or frozen isolate can't permanently eat a user's concurrency quota.

7. **Admin login throttling.** The admin console at `/docs/admin/login` is throttled per client IP via `admin_login_fail:{ip}` counters (KV, 15-minute window, 5 attempts). Further attempts 429 until the window expires; successful login clears the counter. All failures are padded to ≥ 1 s so the throttle path is indistinguishable from a slow mismatch. Client IP is sourced from `CF-Connecting-IP` with `X-Forwarded-For` fallback.

8. **Refresh-token coalescing.** Concurrent tool calls with an expired access token would previously each POST the same refresh_token to Acumatica; IdentityServer rotates refresh tokens on use, so the second request would get `invalid_grant` and evict the user. `getAcumaticaTokenForUser()` (`src/auth/acumatica-oauth.ts`) now coalesces via an in-isolate `inflightLookups: Map<username, Promise<string>>` so parallel callers share a single refresh. The second caller reads the freshly stored access token without re-refreshing.

9. **Role-check misconfig vs. denial.** `checkUserRole()` returns a discriminated result (`granted | denied | misconfigured`). 200 → granted, 403 → denied (user-facing access denied page), 404/5xx/network → misconfigured (separate "Configuration Error" page that points at the likely cause: missing GI, wrong tenant, OData not enabled). Misconfig events are logged as `login_denied` with `reason: role_check_misconfigured` so admins can see real outages rather than them being hidden behind "access denied" tickets.

10. **Redaction regex concurrency.** `src/lib/redact.ts` no longer module-caches compiled regexes. The field-name regex is rebuilt per call (cheap; construction is cheaper than the walk), and the value-shape `SSN` / card regexes are per-call `new RegExp(...)` instances so the mutable `lastIndex` from the `g` flag can't race across concurrent redactions. The field regex drops the `g` flag entirely since it's only used with `.test(key)`.

11. **`unwrapFields` drops `custom`.** Acumatica's `custom` container holds user-defined extension fields in a deeply nested type-tagged wire format (`{"Document": {"UsrField": {"type": "...", "value": ...}}}`). It's user data, but surfacing it as-is would bloat responses and confuse the model. See the comment in `src/lib/acumatica-client.ts` — for workflows that need custom fields, extend the per-entity `acumatica_get_*` tool with `$expand=custom` and a flatten step rather than changing `unwrapFields()` globally.

12. **Registry-driven getters.** The 38 per-entity `acumatica_get_*` tools are defined as data in `src/tools/getter-registry.ts` (`GETTER_TOOLS`). Each entry describes an entity name, parameter list with defaults/optionality, and optional `$expand`. `src/index.ts` loops over the registry and registers each tool via a shared `runGetter()` handler. Adding a new single-record lookup is a ~7-line registry entry — no per-tool handler file, no per-tool `server.tool(...)` block. Utility/discovery tools that do more than a plain GET (pagination envelope, `$metadata` parse, cache invalidation) stay as dedicated handler files.

13. **Config diagnostics.** `src/lib/preflight.ts` exposes a `runPreflight()` probe that exercises every external touch-point: `ACUMATICA_URL` reachable, OIDC discovery, Connected App `client_credentials` grant (distinguishes `invalid_client` — bad creds — from `unsupported_grant_type` — creds valid, grant disabled), tenant OData path (`/t/{tenant}/...` → 401 = exists, 404 = wrong tenant), and contract API endpoint version. Surfaced two places: the admin console (`/docs/admin/preflight` → on-demand diagnostic table) and the `/callback` token-exchange path (known OAuth errors like `invalid_client` / `invalid_grant` are rendered as targeted pages via `interpretTokenError()` instead of a generic 502). Only the `error` field of IdentityServer error bodies is read — other fields can echo the submitted form, which includes `client_secret`.

14. **One-shot deploy.** `setup.sh` at the repo root wraps the full Cloudflare setup (KV namespace create, R2 bucket create, in-place substitution of values into `wrangler.jsonc`, `wrangler secret put` for each secret, `wrangler deploy`). Idempotent — detects an existing KV id in `wrangler.jsonc` and reuses it; skips R2 creation if the bucket already exists; before overwriting `wrangler.jsonc` it saves the previous file to `wrangler.jsonc.local-backup` (gitignored). The substitution targets `ACUMATICA_URL`, `ACUMATICA_TENANT`, `ACUMATICA_ENDPOINT_VERSION`, and the KV `id` field (matches the empty placeholder shipped in the tracked template AND any prior real id, so re-running with the same answers is a no-op). `COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is always generated fresh; `ADMIN_SECRET` is auto-generated if the user leaves the prompt blank (and printed once). After deploy, the script extracts the `*.workers.dev` URL from the deploy output, logs in with the just-set `ADMIN_SECRET`, and calls `/docs/admin/preflight/api` so Acumatica-side misconfig is surfaced in the terminal before the user ever opens a browser. The Acumatica-side prerequisites (Connected App, `MCP Access` role, `MCPAccess` GI) can't be automated and are called out as follow-ups. After first run, prints a hint to run `git update-index --skip-worktree wrangler.jsonc` so future setup re-runs / pulls don't fight with local values.

15. **One-line installer.** `install.sh` at the repo root is served by the worker at `/install.sh` (imported as a text module via the `**/*.sh` rule in `wrangler.jsonc`). Users run `curl -fsSL https://<worker>/install.sh | bash`; it checks for `git`/`node`/`npm`, clones the repo, `npm install`s, and `exec`s `./setup.sh < /dev/tty`. The `/dev/tty` redirect is load-bearing — when piped from curl, stdin is the pipe, so setup.sh's interactive prompts would otherwise immediately EOF. Served with `Content-Type: text/x-shellscript` and `Cache-Control: max-age=300`.

16. **GUI install via Deploy-to-Cloudflare button.** The README links `https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/hallboys/MCP4Acumatica`, which forks the repo to the user's GitHub, reads `wrangler.jsonc`, auto-creates the KV namespace and R2 bucket from the bindings declared with empty `id`/auto-creatable resources, prompts for secrets, and deploys. Vars (`ACUMATICA_URL`, `ACUMATICA_TENANT`, etc.) ship as placeholders that the user edits via the Cloudflare dashboard's `Variables and Secrets` UI after the first deploy — Cloudflare automatically redeploys when vars change. Custom-domain routes are commented out in the committed template; users add them via the Cloudflare dashboard or by editing `wrangler.jsonc` in their fork. This path is the only one that works with no terminal — every other step (Connected App, MCP Access role, MCPAccess GI, dashboard edits) is already a web UI.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Acumatica as sole OAuth provider.** The MCP server redirects directly to Acumatica for login. No separate identity provider layer. See "Historical Note" below for why. The `/callback` route binds the OAuth `state` query parameter to an HttpOnly `acu_oauth_state` cookie set at `/authorize`; mismatch burns the KV state record (`acumatica_state:{state}`) as well as rejecting the request, so the record is single-use even on mismatch.

2. **Per-user Acumatica tokens.** Each MCP user gets their own Acumatica OAuth token stored in KV keyed by `user_token:{acumaticaUsername}`. The user's Acumatica role governs record-level access. The MCP server additionally requires the `MCP Access` role (gate check) and applies sensitive field redaction before returning data to Claude.

3. **`@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`** wraps the entire worker. It acts as an OAuth 2.1 server for Claude, handling both CIMD (Client ID Metadata Documents, preferred) and DCR (Dynamic Client Registration, fallback) for client registration, plus token issuance, etc. The `defaultHandler` (Hono app) manages the Acumatica OAuth redirect flow. The `apiHandler` (McpAgent DO) handles `/mcp` requests with bearer token auth. CIMD requires the `global_fetch_strictly_public` compatibility flag in wrangler.jsonc for SSRF protection.

4. **DO binding must be named `MCP_OBJECT`** — this is the default the `agents` SDK looks for in `McpAgent.serve()`.

5. **Acumatica field values** are wrapped as `{value: X}`. The `unwrapFields()` utility recursively strips these before returning data to Claude.

6. **`AppEnv` / `IKeyValueStore` abstraction.** Tool handlers and shared libraries (`config.ts`, `metadata-cache.ts`, `acumatica-oauth.ts`, `acumatica-client.ts`) use the platform-agnostic `AppEnv` type (which has `store: IKeyValueStore`) instead of the Cloudflare-specific `Env`. In `AcumaticaMcpServer.init()` we construct a fresh `this.appEnv: AppEnv` from `this.env` (never mutating the CF-provided binding object — that reference is shared across requests in the same isolate and hot-patching a `store` field onto it would leak state across sessions). `Env` no longer extends `AppEnv`; it only describes the CF bindings (plus Acumatica connection fields pulled from wrangler.jsonc). CF-specific code (auth handler, admin handler) uses raw `Env` / `KVNamespace` directly.

## Historical Note: Why We Removed Microsoft Entra ID

The initial design used a two-login chained OAuth flow: users first authenticated via Microsoft Entra ID (to identify who they are), then were chained to Acumatica OAuth (to get API permissions). This required a separate Entra app registration, three callback routes, and intermediate state management in KV.

We removed Entra ID entirely because:
- **It was redundant.** Since every user must authenticate with Acumatica anyway (to get a per-user API token with their role-based permissions), the Entra login added no value — Acumatica already knows who the user is.
- **Acumatica can use Entra SSO natively.** If an Acumatica instance is configured with Entra SSO, users still get the Microsoft login experience — it just happens through Acumatica's own login page, not through our MCP server.
- **Simpler flow.** One login instead of two. One callback route instead of three. No Entra secrets to manage.

Old Entra-related secrets (`ENTRA_CLIENT_ID`, `ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ENTRA_TENANT_ID`) may still exist on the Cloudflare side and should be cleaned up with `wrangler secret delete`.

## Configuration

### Tracked deploy template:
- `wrangler.jsonc` — committed at repo root with placeholder values (`""` KV ids, `https://your-instance.acumatica.com`, etc.). Both install paths consume it: the "Deploy to Cloudflare" button reads it from a fork to auto-create bindings; `setup.sh` substitutes real values into it in place. Local production values (real KV id, hallboys-specific routes) are kept in the working tree but suppressed from `git status` via `git update-index --skip-worktree wrangler.jsonc`. The file `wrangler.jsonc.local-backup` is written by setup.sh before overwriting and is gitignored.

### Gitignored (instance-specific):
- `.dev.vars` — secrets for local dev
- `swagger.json` — instance OpenAPI spec
- `wrangler.jsonc.local-backup` — last pre-overwrite copy of `wrangler.jsonc`, written by setup.sh

### Other tracked templates:
- `.dev.vars.example` — documents required secrets

### Environment Variables (in wrangler.jsonc `vars`):
- `ACUMATICA_URL` — e.g., `https://your-instance.acumatica.com`
- `ACUMATICA_TENANT` — Acumatica tenant/login company name (e.g., `Production`). Used for OData GI endpoint URL.
- `ACUMATICA_ENDPOINT_VERSION` — `25.200.001`
- `ACUMATICA_MAX_RECORDS` — max rows per query (default `1000`). Runtime-overridable via `config:acumatica_max_records` in KV (set from the admin console).
- `ACUMATICA_MCP_ROLE` — Acumatica role name required to use MCP (default `"MCP Access"`)
- `REDACT_PATTERNS` — comma-separated additional field name patterns to redact (e.g., `CustomSSN,EmployeeNotes`)
- `REDACT_SKIP` — comma-separated field name patterns to whitelist from redaction (e.g., `BirthDate`)

### Secrets (via `wrangler secret put` or `.dev.vars`):
- `ACUMATICA_CLIENT_ID` — from Acumatica Connected Application (SM303010)
- `ACUMATICA_CLIENT_SECRET` — from Acumatica Connected Application
- `COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — random 256-bit hex (`openssl rand -hex 32`)
- `ADMIN_SECRET` — password for the admin console at `/docs/admin`

### KV Namespaces:
- `TOKEN_STORE` — per-user Acumatica tokens, temporary OAuth state, metadata cache, and runtime config overrides (`config:*` prefix)
- `OAUTH_KV` — required by `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` internally (points to the same physical namespace as `TOKEN_STORE`)

### R2 Buckets:
- `mcp4acumatica_logs` — long-term log storage via Logpush (requires Workers Paid plan for Logpush; R2 free tier: 10 GB)

### Runtime Config (KV-backed):
Settings can be changed at runtime via the admin console at `/docs/admin/settings` without redeploying. KV overrides take precedence over env vars. Changes take effect when the next DO instance starts (DOs recycle within minutes on idle). Config keys stored in KV with `config:` prefix:
- `config:redact_patterns`, `config:redact_skip`
- `config:acumatica_max_records`

### Acumatica Connected Application (SM303010):
- **Redirect URI:** `https://mcp4acumatica.hallboys.com/callback` (plus `https://acumatica-mcp.hallboys.com/callback` while the legacy alias is still live, and the *.workers.dev URL if you use that too — every hostname users connect to must be listed)
- **Scope:** `api openid profile email`

### Acumatica Role & GI Prerequisites:
- **Role:** Create `MCP Access` role (SM201005). No permissions needed — it's a marker role for the canary GI gate check.
- **Generic Inquiry:** Create `MCPAccess` GI (SM208000). Can be trivial (any single column). Assign it only to the `MCP Access` role. Enable **Expose via OData**.
- **User assignment:** Assign the `MCP Access` role to users who should have AI assistant access.

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

- **User identity retrieval:** The OIDC `/identity/connect/userinfo` endpoint (with `openid profile email` scopes) is the primary method. Falls back to `/entity/auth/25.200.001/UserSecurityInfo` which may not exist on all instances. If both fail, username defaults to a UUID-based key (breaks token reuse across sessions).
- **Acumatica system entities not available via contract API:** `User`, `UserRole`, and screen-based API (`/entity/Default/.../screen/SM201010`) all return 404 on SaaS instances. The canary GI approach for role checking was adopted because of this limitation.
- **`$select` on some entities causes Acumatica 500:** Some entities (e.g., Payment) return internal server errors when `$select` is used with certain field names. The `acumatica_list_entities` tool auto-retries without `$select` when this occurs.
- Old Entra ID secrets may still exist on Cloudflare — clean up with `wrangler secret delete ENTRA_CLIENT_ID`, etc.
- **Zod schema constraint:** MCP tool parameter schemas MUST use only simple types (`z.string()`, `z.string().optional()`, `z.string().default("value")`). Complex types like `z.record()`, `z.unknown()`, `z.number()` cause MCP SDK JSON Schema serialization failures and tools won't appear in client discovery. Use `z.string()` with manual `parseInt()` in the handler for numeric parameters.
- **ChatGPT CIMD bug (as of April 2026):** ChatGPT's MCP client sees `client_id_metadata_document_supported: true` in our metadata but fails to complete CIMD (it doesn't have its own metadata document URL) and does not auto-fallback to DCR. Users must manually select DCR when adding the server in ChatGPT. Our server correctly advertises both — this is a ChatGPT client-side issue.
- **Claude.ai tool list caching:** Claude.ai may cache the tool list from a previous Durable Object session. If tools appear stale, disconnect and reconnect the MCP server in Claude.ai to force a fresh `init()` call.

## MCP Client Compatibility (as of April 2026)

| Client | Registration | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Claude.ai (Team/Pro/Max/Enterprise) | DCR | ✅ Works — uses `/register` |
| Claude Code (v2.1.81+) | CIMD preferred, DCR fallback | ✅ Works — publishes metadata at `https://claude.ai/oauth/claude-code-client-metadata` |
| Claude Desktop | DCR | ✅ Works — uses `/register` |
| ChatGPT | DCR (manual selection required) | ⚠️ Works with manual DCR — CIMD auto-detection broken on their side |

### OAuth Discovery Endpoints

The server responds on three well-known paths (all return identical metadata):
- `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (and `/mcp` suffixed variant) — RFC 9728
- `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` — RFC 8414
- `/.well-known/openid-configuration` — added for ChatGPT compatibility (proxies to oauth-authorization-server)

## Acumatica API Patterns

### Endpoint format:
```
GET {ACUMATICA_URL}/entity/Default/{version}/{Entity}/{key}
```

### Common query parameters:
- `$expand=SubEntity1,SubEntity2` — include nested records
- `$filter=Field eq 'value'` — filter results
- `$select=Field1,Field2` — limit returned fields
- `$top=N` — limit result count

### Field value wrapping:
Every Acumatica field is `{value: X}`. Use `unwrapFields()` before returning to Claude.

### Auth header:
```
Authorization: Bearer {per-user-access-token}
```
